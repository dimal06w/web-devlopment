            <h1>Virat Kohli Foundation</h1>
            <p>Virat Kohli, former captain of the Indian men’s cricket team set up the Virat Kohli Foundation (VKF)<br> in 2013 to fulfill his dream of making India a sporting superpower and supporting potential athletes <br>to achieve their dreams and reach the pinnacle in their respective sport.</p>
            <p>Virat’s ambitions for a better India have grown beyond the sports arena to creating a better<br> tomorrow for the underprivileged youth of our country. He is committed to build youth focused <br>programs, which connect children to resources and use his partnerships to setup support services<br> to the vulnerable section of our society.</p>
            <p>He and Anushka are both passionate about animals and they have made personal contributions consistently<br> to help the cause of the thousands of stray animals in our city, as well as contributed<br> to wildlife relief efforts. With his support extended to Awaaz, he can create well planned medical <br>services, shelter and food to the strays that are the forgotten and often brutalised in Mumbai.</p>
            <p>We believe in research, and our team is constantly meeting with innovators and leading experts<br> to understand the problems faced by our disadvantaged youth and how we can make the most of our<br> resources to drive real action which will leave a lasting impact and build a better future for our India.</p>
